# Overview
The TSP is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to determine the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities exactly once. This project implements the above algorithms from scratch to solve the TSP efficiently.

# Algorithms Implemented
- Genetic Algorithm: Inspired by the process of natural selection, this algorithm evolves a population of candidate solutions over generations to find an optimal or near-optimal solution.

- Hill Climbing: A local search algorithm that iteratively moves to the neighboring solution with the highest improvement in the objective function, aiming to find a local optimum.

- Nearest Neighbor: A heuristic that constructs a tour by repeatedly visiting the nearest unvisited city, starting from an initial city.

- Tabu Search: An advanced local search method that uses memory structures to avoid cycling back to previously visited solutions, thereby exploring the solution space more effectively.
